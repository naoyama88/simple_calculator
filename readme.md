## What I use
- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JS (on html)

## What is most difficult
- Decide which button do I put in calculator
- CSS for all size of browser
- JS is not so hard because the function is really simple

## What I couldn't solve
- Design things
- The color of button is going to be weird when tap it on smart phone
- Wanted characters in display to get shrank when a lot of numbers or operators are put
- Wanted to put ',' in every 3 numbers
